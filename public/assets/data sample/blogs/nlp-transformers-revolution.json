      "text": "## The Rise of Transformers\n\nIntroduced in the landmark 2017 paper \"Attention Is All You Need,\" transformer models replaced recurrent neural networks with **self-attention mechanisms**, enabling more efficient parallel processing and better modeling of long-range dependencies in text. This architectural innovation set the stage for a series of increasingly powerful language models."
