  "content": "This paper explores the application of transformer-based architectures for automatic code generation, with a focus on improving accuracy and maintaining code quality. We present a novel approach that combines pre-training on large code repositories with fine-tuning on domain-specific codebases. Our model demonstrates significant improvements over previous approaches in terms of syntactic correctness, semantic accuracy, and code readability. We also introduce a new benchmark for evaluating code generation systems across multiple programming languages and problem domains.",
