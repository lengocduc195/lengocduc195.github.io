  "content": "This survey provides a comprehensive overview of graph neural network applications in molecular property prediction, covering recent advances, challenges, and future directions. We systematically categorize existing approaches based on their architectural designs, training strategies, and application domains. The paper also discusses key challenges in the field, including limited labeled data, model interpretability, and out-of-distribution generalization. We conclude with a discussion of promising research directions and potential applications in drug discovery and materials science.",
