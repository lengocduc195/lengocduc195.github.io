The speedboat sliced through turquoise waves, carrying us to Hòn Mun. The promise was simple: 'Lặn là thấy cá, ngoi là thấy người.' True to its word, the underwater world exploded with color as we snorkeled among vibrant fish and coral, laughter bubbling up with every new discovery."

The afternoon led us to Hòn Tằm, where we let the mud baths and hydro-massage wash away all fatigue. The hot mineral pool left us blissfully relaxed, and for a moment, time seemed to slow to the rhythm of the waves."

In those moments, titles and roles faded; we were just friends, living in the present, bound by the joy of shared adventure."

Sometimes, it’s about being there for each other when it matters most."

I returned home with a heart full of gratitude, new friendships, and a renewed sense of what it means to be part of a team."
