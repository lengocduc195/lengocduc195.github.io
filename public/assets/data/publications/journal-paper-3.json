  "content": "This paper presents novel algorithms and implementation strategies for energy-efficient deep learning on resource-constrained IoT devices. We introduce a systematic approach to model compression, quantization, and hardware-aware neural architecture search that significantly reduces energy consumption while maintaining acceptable accuracy. Our experimental evaluation on various IoT platforms demonstrates up to 85% reduction in energy usage compared to baseline implementations. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs between model accuracy, inference latency, and energy consumption across different IoT applications and hardware configurations.",
