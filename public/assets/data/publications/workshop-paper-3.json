  "content": "This paper explores reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating improved sample efficiency and task performance. We present a framework that efficiently incorporates different forms of human feedback, including demonstrations, preferences, and corrections, into the reinforcement learning process. Our approach addresses key challenges in robotics, such as reward specification, exploration, and safety constraints. Experiments on a range of manipulation tasks show that our method significantly reduces the number of physical interactions required while improving success rates compared to traditional reinforcement learning approaches.",
