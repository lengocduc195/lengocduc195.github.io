    "content": "This paper presents a comprehensive survey of deep learning techniques in computer vision, covering recent advances in convolutional neural networks, transformers, and their applications in various vision tasks. We discuss the evolution of deep learning architectures, from traditional CNNs to modern transformer-based models, and their impact on computer vision applications. The survey also includes detailed discussions on training strategies, optimization techniques, and future directions in the field.",
