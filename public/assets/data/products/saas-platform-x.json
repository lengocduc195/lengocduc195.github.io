    "content": "This project implements a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network for image recognition tasks. The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled images and can recognize objects across multiple categories with high accuracy.\n\nThe architecture uses a combination of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to extract features from input images and classify them into predefined categories. Transfer learning techniques were applied by fine-tuning a pre-trained model on custom datasets to improve performance.\n\nKey features of this project include:\n- Real-time object detection with bounding boxes\n- Multi-class classification with confidence scores\n- Web interface for uploading and processing images\n- REST API for integration with other applications",
