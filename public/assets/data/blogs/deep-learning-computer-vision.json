      "text": "## Transformer Architectures for Vision\n\nWhile Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have dominated computer vision for nearly a decade, transformer-based architectures like **Vision Transformer (ViT)** and **Swin Transformer** are now achieving state-of-the-art results on many vision tasks. These models adapt the self-attention mechanism from natural language processing to handle visual data."

      "text": "## Self-Supervised Learning\n\nOne of the most promising directions in computer vision is **self-supervised learning**, which allows models to learn useful representations from unlabeled data. Methods like DINO, MoCo, and SimCLR have shown that models pre-trained with self-supervision can match or even exceed the performance of supervised pre-training on many downstream tasks."

    {
      "type": "text",
      "text": "## Multimodal Learning\n\nModels that can understand both visual and textual information, such as **CLIP** (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), have opened up new possibilities for zero-shot learning and more intuitive human-AI interaction. These models learn to align images and text in a shared embedding space, enabling remarkable capabilities like searching for images using natural language descriptions."
